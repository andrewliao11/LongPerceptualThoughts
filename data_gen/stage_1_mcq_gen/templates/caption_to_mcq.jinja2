Task:
You are given a detailed description of an image. Your goal is to generate diverse vision-centric, detailed questions that require a careful examination of the image for subtle visual details. Each question should be answerable in a brief sentence or single phrase.
Instructions: 
- Focus on Visual Detail:
    - Ask questions that require examining fine details such as textures, patterns, and small or hidden elements.
    - Encourage the reader to analyze spatial relationships like object overlap, perspective, and layout.
- Comprehensive Coverage:
    - Ensure that the questions, as a group, address the majority of important details mentioned in the image description.
- Design for Multiple-Choice:
    - For each question, provide 4 answer options labeled A, B, C, and D.
    - Include one correct answer and three plausible distractors.
- Encourage Careful Inspection:
    - Design each question so that it cannot be answered without a close, careful visual inspection of the image.
    - Avoid generic or overly broad questions; each should target specific visual cues mentioned or implied in the description.
- Clarity, Specificity, and Brevity in Answers:
    - Formulate questions that are clear and focused on visual elements.
    - Ensure each question is detailed enough to challenge the reader to look beyond the surface.
    - Avoid questions that can be answered with general knowledge or assumptions.
    - Each question should be answerable in a brief sentence or even a single phrase.
- Indicate Question Type:
    - For each question, specify the reasoning type involved (e.g., Analogical and Goal-Oriented Reasoning, Causal and Commonsense Reasoning, Spatial and Relational Reasoning, Counting and Quantification, Recognition). You may also use other appropriate types beyond these five if necessary.
- Structured Output:
    - Provide the questions in a numbered list.
    - Example Format: 1. <question> question here </question> <choices> (A) ... (B) ... (C) ... (D) ...  </choices> <answer> short answer here </answer> <type> reasoning type here </type>
