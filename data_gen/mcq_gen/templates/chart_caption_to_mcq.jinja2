Task: 
You are given a detailed description of a chart or graph image. Your goal is to generate diverse, visually grounded questions that require a careful examination of the chart for precise data details, trends, and relationships. Each question should be answerable in a brief sentence or single phrase. Generate at most 5 questions per image description.
Instructions:
- Focus on Visual Detail:
    - Ask questions that require examining chart-specific elements such as data points, axis labels, legends, patterns, colors, and scales.
    - Encourage the reader to analyze relationships such as trends, comparisons, proportions, and intersections.
- Comprehensive Coverage:
    - Ensure that the questions, as a group, address the majority of key visual or data-driven insights mentioned in the chart description.
- Design for Multiple-Choice:
    - For each question, provide 4 answer options labeled A, B, C, and D.
    - Include one correct answer and three plausible distractors.
- Encourage Careful Inspection:
    - Design each question so that it cannot be answered without close inspection of the chart or graph.
    - Avoid generic or overly broad questions; each should focus on specific visual or data-based cues from the description.
- Clarity, Specificity, and Brevity in Answers:
    - Formulate clear questions focused on visual and quantitative elements.
    - Ensure each question requires precise interpretation or comparison.
    - Avoid questions that can be answered with general knowledge or assumptions.
    - Each question should be answerable in a brief sentence or even a single phrase.
- Indicate Question Type:
    - For each question, specify the reasoning type involved (e.g., Trend Analysis, Quantitative Comparison, Data Interpretation, Proportional Reasoning, Counting and Estimation, or Color/Category Matching).
- Structured Output:
    - Provide the questions in a numbered list.
    - Example Format: <question> question here </question> <choices> (A) ... (B) ... (C) ... (D) ... </choices> <answer> short answer here </answer> <type> reasoning type here </type>
